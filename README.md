# WiFi and Bluetooth monitor tool

Private repository of bachelors thesis by Samuel Petráš, student of FEEC VUT.

## Abstract
This bachelors thesis is concerned with the collection of information about nearby devices which use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth communication. The standards of 2.4GHz wireless communication, monitoring techniques and associated issues are discussed in the theoretical section. The proposed solution outlines a method, which can be used for the automation of such monitoring using airodump-ng and Bluelog software on a Raspberry Pi system, allowing for the collected data to be saved to a database for future manipulation.
